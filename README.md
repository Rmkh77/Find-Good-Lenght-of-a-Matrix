# Find-Good-Lenght-of-a-Matrix
Problem Statement:
You are given a matrix A of size N*M. Any length 'L' can be called good length if there is at least one square matrix of size L*L in A such that all elements in that square matrix are greater than or equal to L. You need to output the maximum good length for given matrix.
